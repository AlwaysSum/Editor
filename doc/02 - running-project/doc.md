# Running the application/game

Once all dependencies have been installed and the game built, the game be ran using 2 mthods:
* In an integrated browser: simply opens a new window with the application/game rendered in it
* In the default browser of the user: will start a local webserver and open the default browser of the user (FireFox for example).

For developers, running the game in the default browser of the user will allow to easily open the devtools (using F12) and debug the game.

By default, the Editor will open the integrated browser. To have options drawn in the Editor, simply `right-click` the `Play` button in the toolbar and select `Play in my browser`:
